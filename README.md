# cIOX Embedded Communication Samples via CAN
This repository offers a comprehensive set of sample scripts designed for embedded development and testing of custom Input/Output Expander (cIOX) devices. The samples, available in C, Python, and JavaScript, facilitate communication between the IOX device, the GO device, and MyGeotab servers through the CAN bus and MyGeotab cloud interfaces.

The repository provides practical examples of IOX device interactions over CAN and the MyGeotab cloud, aiming to improve understanding and implementation of the IOX protocol. These samples help developers and integrators streamline their testing and development processes, ensuring reliable communication and accurate data exchange within the embedded system.

## Functionality Overview
This repository is designed to deepen the understanding of the IOX protocol by providing examples of key communication processes, entailing the following:

### IOX Internal Logic
The repository includes scripts that demonstrate how to read and process inbound CAN messages, construct outbound messages from the IOX device, and transmit them over the CAN bus to the GO device. These messages can then be sent to MyGeotab servers, facilitating cloud-based interactions.

### MyGeotab Cloud Interactions
The scripts also cover how to use the MyGeotab API to send and receive information over the cloud. This includes handling the transmission of data from the GO device to the MyGeotab servers and retrieving it for further processing.

### Message Logging
The scripts capture and log all inbound and outbound messages over the CAN bus, allowing developers to monitor and analyze the data exchanged between the IOX and GO devices. This logging functionality helps in debugging and ensures that the data flow is as expected. Here is an example of a MIME message being read and decoded by the IOX:

The logging table contains the following information for each message:
| Log Field | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Direction | Indicates whether the message was sent or received, providing context on the flow of data through the CAN bus |
| DateTime | Records the time at which the message traverses the CAN bus |
| ArbID | Displays the arbitration ID of the message, as used in the arbitration process |
| DLC | Shows the Data Length Code, a field in the CAN frame specifying the length of the payload in bytes |
| Data | Contains the payload of the message, displayed in hexadecimal |
| Description | Provides a narrative or classification of the message's effect based on the arbitration ID and payload |

## Directory Structure
### MIME Inbound
This directory contains scripts that handle the reception and processing of MIME messages. Messages are pushed from the MyGeotab SDK API to the cloud, received by the GO device, and transmitted over CAN to the IOX device. The script then reads, decodes, and reconstructs the MIME message. For detailed documentation, see [here](MIME_inbound/README.md).

### MIME Outbound
Scripts in this directory manage the construction and transmission of MIME messages from the IOX device to the MyGeotab server. The script encodes a given message into a payload under the higher level MIME protocol structure. The payload is pushed through the MyGeotab cloud via the GO deviceâ€™s TCP socket buffer and modem. An API call then retrieves and decodes the message from the cloud. For more information, refer to [this](MIME_outbound/README.md) documentation.

### GO/IOX Data Transfer
This directory contains scripts for transferring single-frame and multi-frame data log types 0x1D, 0x1E, and 0x27 between the IOX and GO devices. This entails the requesting, transmission, and retrieval of status, priority, and free-format third party data. For a comprehensive overview, see [here](GO_IOX_data_transfer/README.md).

### Custom Messaging
This directory includes scripts for sending and retrieving custom messages using 0x1E multi-frame data logs from an IOX device to a GO device via the CAN bus. The `custom_messaging.py` and `custom_messaging.c` scripts construct and send the custom payloads, while `custom_messaging_retrieve.js` and `custom_messaging_retrieve.py` fetch and decode these messages from the MyGeotab cloud. For further details, refer to the [custom messaging README](custom_messaging/README.md).

### Protobuf 
Protobuf, handled by 0x1E and 0x27 type 13 CAN frames, provides an extensible mechanism for serializing structured data in both outbound and inbound directions from the IOX. Leveraging a subscription/publication framework, the IOX can subscribe to a specific data type from the GO device using 0x1E. In response, the GO device will send a log every time the subscribed data changes, up to approximately 1 Hz via 0x27. The source IOX protobuf schema can be found [here](https://github.com/Geotab/android-external-device-example/blob/master/app/src/main/proto/iox_messaging.proto).

### Functions
These scripts define functions for sending messages over the CAN terminal and classifying inbound messages based on arbitration ID and payload. These functions are crucial for effective logging and payload handling. This entails `functions.py`, `functions.c`, and `functions.h`.

### Idle Communication Template
These samples provide a minimal implementation for communication between the GO and IOX devices. Thus, they serve as a template for GO/IOX interaction script development over the CAN bus. This includes `idle_communication_template.py` and `idle_communication_template.c`.

### Makefile
A Makefile is provided in the root directory to compile the C scripts. Each C script is compiled into a separate executable. The Makefile also includes commands for cleaning up the compiled binaries.

## Configuration
These sample scripts are developed using the PiCAN board, which is a CAN bus interface for Raspberry Pi. CAN message transmission and reception are handled using the `<linux/can.h>` header and the `python-can` library. API interactions are managed through the MyGeotab SDK API, accessible [here](https://geotab.github.io/sdk/software/api/runner.html). 

The scripts controlling IOX behavior are implemented in both C and Python. Similarly, API calls are demonstrated using both JavaScript and Python. It is important to note that the C and Python scripts, as well as the JavaScript and Python scripts, do not interact with each other. Instead, each pair of languages is used to achieve the same functionality, providing a choice of implementation for better interpretability and flexibility for integrators and developers.

### Setting Up the Environment
**Linux/macOS**: To install dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:
```
bash install_dependencies.sh
```
**Windows**: To install dependencies, run the following command in your PowerShell:
```
pip install os-sys
pip install mygeotab
```

### Building and Running C Scripts
```
make                          # compile all C scripts
./exc_mime_inbound_sample     # execute one of the scripts
make clean                    # clean up compiled binaries
```
- `make`: Compiles all the C scripts in the repository, generating executables for each script.
- `./exc_mime_inbound_sample`: Executes one of the compiled C scripts. Replace exc_mime_inbound_sample with the name of the executable you want to run.
- `make clean`: Removes all compiled binaries to clean up the build environment.
